An if statement is a section of code that allows a piece of code to work as long as the statement is true.
if(1 + 2 == 3) Since the statement is true, whatever this script will run
if(1 + 3 == 7) Since this statement is false, the script will not run
if statements can be used with integers and variables
if(num1 + num2 == value) if the variables are changed to make the statement true, then the script will run
if(num1 + num2 == value) if the variables are changed to make the statement false, then the script will not run
if statements can only be used inside of a function
if statements are used when the scripter wants something to happen, but only if something else happens first
if statements are often used with else clauses
if statements can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and greater than, equal to, less than, not equal to, greater than or equal to, and less then or equal to equations
if(5 > 2) is a true statement so the script would run
if(9 < 1) is a false statement so the script would not run
